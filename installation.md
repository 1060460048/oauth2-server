# Installation

The recommended way of installing the library is via Composer.

In your project root just run:

~~~ shell
composer require league/oauth2-server:4.0.x-dev
~~~

Now, assuming you have [installed Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) run `composer update`.

Ensure now that youâ€™ve set up your project to [autoload Composer-installed packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading).
